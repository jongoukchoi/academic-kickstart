# Biography
I am the second year PhD student at the Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science being advised by Dr.Â Changhee Jung.
My research interests include high performance computing, architecture/compiler, and intermittent computing.
Before joining CS@VT, I was a undergraduate/graduate student at Kentucky State University working with Prof. Chi Shen and Prof.Jens Hannemann.
From 2012 to 2015, I was a research engineer at LG Electronics Car Laboratory studying about high performance embedded system design.
I also worked at NASA EPSCOR with Dr. Alexandre Martin as a student intern in 2017.
